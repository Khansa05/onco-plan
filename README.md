## 🧠 Problem Statement

In Pakistan, radiotherapy treatment planning is conducted manually by radiation oncologists and medical physicists, leading to a time-consuming and error-prone process. The lack of an AI-powered system results in inconsistencies across hospitals, delays in treatment, and increased workload for medical professionals. Additionally, manual dose fraction calculations and patient-specific radiotherapy schedules contribute to inefficiencies, particularly in regions with limited access to specialized expertise. This gap in automation affects the accuracy and timeliness of cancer treatment, ultimately impacting patient outcomes and survival rates. There is an urgent need for an AI-driven solution to streamline radiotherapy planning, enhance precision, and improve healthcare efficiency.
